# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer churn using AWS services. The pipeline includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring, providing a robust framework for developing and deploying machine learning models in the cloud.

## Components
- **Data Ingestion**: Load data from various sources (e.g., Amazon S3, CSV files).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a REST API using AWS SageMaker.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and logging for performance evaluation and alerts.
