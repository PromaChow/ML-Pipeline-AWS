# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer churn using AWS services. The pipeline includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring, providing a robust framework for developing and deploying machine learning models in the cloud.

## Components
- **Data Ingestion**: Load data from various sources (e.g., Amazon S3, CSV files).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a REST API using AWS SageMaker.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and logging for performance evaluation and alerts.

 # GitHub Actions workflow configuration
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account set up with permissions to use SageMaker.
- **Docker**: Install Docker to build and run containers.
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher is recommended.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Pipeline-AWS.git
   cd ML-Pipeline-AWS

2. Install the required Python packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Build the Docker image:
     docker build -t ml-pipeline-aws .
Usage
1. Preprocess the data:

python src/preprocess.py

2. Train the model:

python src/train_model.py

3. Deploy the model:

python src/deploy_model.py

## GitHub Actions
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (aws_pipeline.yml) that automates the CI/CD process for the pipeline. It runs on code pushes to the main branch and executes the following steps:

# Checkout the code
# Install dependencies
# Preprocess data
# Train the model
# Deploy the model
